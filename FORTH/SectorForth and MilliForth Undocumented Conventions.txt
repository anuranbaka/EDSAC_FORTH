EDSAC Forth takes many conventions from the original "Going Forth" FORTH, JonesForth
and SectorForth/MilliForth. So it's helpful to have some docs on those.
I think SectorForth is the only one not well doc'd, so I'm writing the needed details here.
In particular, anything that would need to be known to port code from them to other systems.


Undocumented conventions from SectorForth and MilliForth:
- : is a primitive word, as is ; 
- - These are the only two words not called out in README. I checked.
- The top bit of the *word* pointed to by LATEST indicates IMMEDIATE
- The top bit of the *byte* pointed to by LATEST indicates HIDDEN
- The unaligned access loads of x86 are required for various things to work
