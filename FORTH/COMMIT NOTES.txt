Added support for FORTH words, by including ENTER/DOCOL and EXIT. Also modified NEXT for native support.

Work estimate so far: [2 weeks before versioning started + 12hrs,
+ 1 hr 12/15? thinking about chimeric push and pop word tails (not done!)
+ 2 hr 12/16 EXIT and ENTER impls
+ 2 hr 12/17 Debug EXIT and ENTER and document them, and demo FORTH words
+ 2 hr 12/18 Write short FORTH word system and demo it, plus this commit

This commit demonstrates using the top bits of the address to do special things (in this case indicate a FORTH word). 
I have also reduced the overhead of a FORTH word to 2.5 machine words exactly, from 3.75 average! FORTH words can now 
be jammed together without padding due to no longer requiring machine code at the beginning. FORTH words are now have less overhead than CODE words!
