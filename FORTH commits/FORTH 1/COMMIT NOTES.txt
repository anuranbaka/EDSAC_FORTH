I now have 3 words working, and some demo byte code!
The words are
0: halt the machine
1: Print "HI" <-- let's us check we didn't break the interpreter
2: Read a word from input into a packed 3 letter code, and discard following space

The todo is that I need to get packed 3 letter codes to start with "."'s in unused letters, ('.' is no-op on the teletype)
