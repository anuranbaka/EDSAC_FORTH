Hello world commit! See notes below for progress
Dec 12, 2024 - Roughly 2 month in to starting this. 2 man-weeks of work so far!

EDSAC FORTH.txt 
is my notes on making a FORTH for EDSAC, and is hand assembled into the
FORTH Subroutines code.

FORTH Subroutines.txt 
is the real meat of what I've made so far. It currently includes an
implementation of NEXT, along with a FORTH memory layout and demo
word that prints "HI"!

Overall I have taken an approach of writing code in a slighly 
expanded version of the EDSAC assembly that includes constants
and variable addresses in "" . I call this language PE for Paul-EDSAC (yes, I'm vain :-P ). 

These constants are then hand assembled into the constant area in the FORTH system, and the PE is assembled into pure EDSAC. To keep constistent,
I put the PE source lines in comments in the EDSAC assembly.
