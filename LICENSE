LICENSE
You may use this repository as you see fit, but if you make changes you must either fork the original github repository 
from https://github.com/anuranbaka
or post an issue there informing me you are developing off of it (this is so I know how popular this repo is).
And this license file must be kept unchanged in the root of the repo. If needed, you can rename it to allow 
multiple license files for different parts of your repo.
